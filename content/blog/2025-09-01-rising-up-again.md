I'm honest with you, the reason why I did not write anything last week is just because I forgot, but let's consider it as my annual leave and go on, I'm back!

Week 7 was the one I touched the bottom, of not being able to sleep, and rose back again. I won't tell the details but after a certain episode I decided to take the situation back into my hands, asked Google Gemini to prepare me an incremental training program to start excercising again, and also to slowly try to get back to run.

7 years ago I had an accident: a bad landing with a parachute resulted in a couple of broken bones in my left leg. After that, I wasn't able to **fully** recover muscles in that leg, mostly because I never committed enough in sports. So, every time I tried to jog, after 3km my left foot would start to get numb, and slowly take over to the leg, so I'd just stop.

I'm happy to say that I'm 2 weeks in m new training program, without missing a single day. And my sleep improved **drastically**. A side effect is that my focus during the day improved as well.

My wife got a surgery 2 Fridays ago, and the week after was the busiest week from a dog sitter PoV, because everyone was on holidays and they left their animals for my wife to take care. She just got an operation so she needed my help, not the easiest of my weeks, frankly. But magically on Sunday we were free again, everyone came back from holidays, my wife can now rest and me as well.

A very stressfull month is approaching but that's a story for next time.

I'm aware that no-one reads this blog, I mostly write it for myself, but if you're reading, thank you.
I'll see you next wee.
