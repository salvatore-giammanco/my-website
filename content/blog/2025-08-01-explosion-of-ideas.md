Yes, I'm cheating already. I'm writing this post from the future, but hey, this is my blog, so I do as I please.

The only word that pops up to my mind when I think about last week is "rollecoaster". I haven't had this many ideas all at once in a long time, and I'm speaking about the ideas that keep me up till 5 in the morning.
<!-- more -->
Let's put some order. On Monday, as promised, I went to my old high school and met again with my professor so he showed me around the labs. They have so many 3D printers, I wish I could be a teenager again right now just to go to school and use the labs.
We also spoke about some projects we could go together, and here is where some ideas come from: that night I had a hard time sleeping.

The whole week was ups and downs, many ideas --> no sleep --> zero focus during the day. That all came to a head on Friday when I was awake until 5AM.

It wasn't all bad, though. All these ideas will hopefully have an outcome and I'll be able to talk about them here soon.

I'll leave you with a few pictures of the desertic school.
