Last week and last weekend I really managed to relax, so i thought this week would be a productive one. And indeed it started like that, at work I used the excuse that I had to catch up from the holidays to burn down my entire list of saved messages on slack: it was over 80 threads and it took me slightly more than two days. Two full days of focus on burning down that list. Monday and Tuesday. After that, focus started to fade out until Thursday in which I did not accomplish absolutely anything.  Fucking ADHD, sometimes I wonder if meds would help, but I cannot swallow pills anyway.

I shouldâ€™ve wrote here yesterday but I did not really have the inspiration, so here we are.

Finally, yesterday I was able to watch Fantastic 4 at the cinema: a good movie, I will say no more. Almost more importantly, I was able to watch the Avatar 3 teaser trailer, which exclusively airs in theatres before Fantastic 4: stunning, I will say no more.

Itâ€™s a rainy Saturday, today, and it feels like October. I couldnâ€™t be happier about this. 
Every year, when August approaches, I start to crave Halloween and a colder weather. Well, today is a really Halloween-ish day, and I just love it.

I wish to spend less time on the computer and the phone.

I was almost forgetting but this week I grabbed a beer with an old friend of mine: a professor of mine from high school. Heâ€™s the one that introduced me to the world of microcontrollers and allowed my years at high school to be the best of my life: I just spent a lot of time in the lab making robots. Iâ€™m going to go back at school on Monday, prof wants to show me how the lab advanced during the years. Iâ€™m looking forward to that ðŸ¤–.
