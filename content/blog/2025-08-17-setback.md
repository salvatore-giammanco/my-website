The week I was *looking forward to*, has passed, and I'm disappointed. Disappointed by myself, mostly. This time for myself was supposed to be dedicated to a healtier life-style, but it turned out to be the opposite. A big heat wave, my hateful neighbors, the fact that I had to take care of 3 animals besides myself, (I can barely take care of myself), all these things pushed me to consume a lot of junk food. The trend of sleeplessness continued, as well as the low-focus one.

Not everything was bad though, I managed to start a little house-work project and to work a bit on a project that hopefully I will share soon on the tech blog.

What else can I say? One night, I was in bed, not being able to sleep. So I started wandering with my mind, and I created a mental palace, my very first one. I was very surprised on how easy it was to memorise things with this technique, it really feels like a superpower.
I created a palace of happy memories  (actually, it's a work in progress). I read somewhere that this trick can help to manage anxiety caused by PTSD.

As usual, I overthink everything, so I still can't choose where to memorize something practically useful that I might be able to use at work to perform better. I cannot even decide **what** to memorise. Will keep thinking about this.

I hope next week will be a better one, when will I see the end of this horrible heat wave?
