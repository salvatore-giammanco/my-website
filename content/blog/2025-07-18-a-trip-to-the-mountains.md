Here we are at the second post of this blog, it's Friday and yes, I almost forgot about it.

I had a really nice week because, as I anticipated in the previous post, I went on a little trip to the mountains with my wife and our dog. This was our first time camping with the dog, and actually our second time camping together at all. I'm confident to say that the experiment went pretty well, fur in the tent aside.

It started a bit rough because at the time we were mounting our tent, it started raining, and, after too much time being confused, we found out that 4 plastic guides have been mounted in wrong positions. But everything turned out just fine: we did a long hike the second day, which was amazing, and went on shorter walks the other days. Ymir (our dog) was tremendously happy all the time.

I think I managed to relax and get the rest I needed for a long time.

Yesterday we came back home and since then I played too much Minecraft. I just needed it.

Today, a book I ordered last week was delivered, it's [Dani Donovan's Anti-Planner](https://anti-planner.com/shop/the-anti-planner-how-to-get-sht-done-when-you-dont-feel-like-it/?srsltid=AfmBOoolCbXow3rwNAYolMWvZYD8SKSsBqxGIB0NBA8jB4QV5bENlILS), a manual that was suggested in a group chat about neurodiversity we have at work. It's a manual that's supposed to help getting shit done when you don't feel like it. I already tried it today, because I had to clean and tidy-up my office, and it was amazing! Will write more updates on this.

Nothing more to say for this week, see you soon!
