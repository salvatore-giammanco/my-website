Hello, I think that from now on I'm going to write on Sundays, so I can have a true summary of a full week.

This week was the organic sequel of the previous one: I kept having ideas of projects and great desire of improving my lifestyle. I got into preparing healtier meals for myself, the problem is that it takes time and I'm always in lack of time. Last week I instaleld a self-hosted service that allows me to store my own recipes, and this week I had the chance to save a few ones. It's still a bit early to give opinions on the tool, but if you want to try that out, it's called [Tandoor Recipes](https://docs.tandoor.dev).

It's really hard to keep all these ideas out of my head during my work day, I feel like this is one of the things that contributes to my lack of focus. Another thing I noticed, is the combo of boring tasks and lack of human interaction in a full-remote working environment. Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't work in any other way, but there's always some trade-offs. While I constantly work to find my perfect balance, I'm still pretty far from that. But writing here could help me keep track of things, for example I found out that a brief huddle with someone about a though problem, a boring task, or wathever task I cannot initiate, really boots my brain for a little while, creating momentum.

I'm socially lazy. This means that I try to avoid human interations as much as possible, by default. I'm conscious that this is not a good thing, even if I trhive when I'm alone, I really enjoy that. When I get to spend time alone I have the best ideas, I can be free within my mind.
The tricky part here is to find an equilibrium between being alone and spending time with people.

From time to time I go to work to the Milan office, that usually helps breaking the monotony, but I feel like I'm being held home by PTSD. I don't like going out in big cities, at the moment. I feel constantly anxious that someone could rob me. This is the main reason why I'm in therapy. It's very early to say how that's going but I'm slowly building a strategy to fight anxiety with rationality. I'm also experimenting with the Method of Loci, but that story is for another day.

I just brought my wife to the airport, she's going to Croatia last minute for a week, because her best friend is not well, so she wants to be with her. I'm left here with 2 dogs and a cat. Yes, 2 dogs because my wife is dog sitting a little cute monster, a tiny Chihuahua with abandonment issues: she can't stay alone for a moment that she starts to cry. I kind of like her, but every time she's being annoying I have to be careful, the risk of meltdown low but always there.

That felt like an emotional dump, hey I'm not sorry!
See you next week
