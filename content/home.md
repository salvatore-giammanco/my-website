# Ahoy Matey! 🏴‍☠️

My name is **Salvatore Giammanco** and I am a Software Developer currently working for Flowe as Software Engineer. I worked for 3 years as a computer programmer and web designer. Honestly, I got bored. Don’t get me wrong, I love programming, but I need the right reason to do it. I’ve been working for companies whose purpose was making rich people even more rich, all of this without caring about the biggest problem the humanity is facing on: global warming. Do you think covid-19 is a big problem? Let’s wait few years.

# What’s my Mission?

I want to create technology, innovation and hope for a better future. And I will do it, by understanding how nature really works. Because we need sustainable systems which make us able to live on this planet, or others, for an UNLIMITED amount of time, without consuming the planet’s resources until they are depleted, and we need it now!

Our society should work like an ecosystem, in symbiosis with nature.
