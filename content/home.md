# Ahoy Matey! 🏴‍☠️

My name is **Salvatore Giammanco** and I am a **Software Developer** currently working for 🐙 Kraken Technologies 🐙 as Software Engineer.

# What’s my Mission?

I want to create technology, innovation and hope for a better future. We need sustainable systems which make us able to live on this planet, or others, for an UNLIMITED amount of time, without consuming the planet’s resources until they are depleted, and we need it now!

Our society should work like an ecosystem, in symbiosis with nature.
